###Pinterest Notification to Discord Bot
Very simple "bot" designed to be hosted on Zapier. It monitors a pinterest board, and when a new image is pinned, it posts that image to a Discord webhook.

Just fill in {{THESE_BITS}} with your info and add the code to a Javascript step on Zapier. You'll also need to set up the Pinterest trigger to supply the inputData variable

Zapier has 'fetch' installed by default as of 2019.
